          We're always looking for new locations to host meetups, as well as
          folks on the ground to act as local organizers and MCs.
          <br />
          <br />
          Involvement might include working with your employers to provide a
          space, organizing catering for meetup attendees, ensuring that there
          is a livestream or opportunity to record the speakers, and generally
          working to ensure that the meetup runs smoothly.
